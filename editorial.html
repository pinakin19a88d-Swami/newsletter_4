							Hello All,  <br><br>

							Feeling nice to touch base with all of you once again. Hope you all enjoyed most of the monsoon although it wasn't all that remarkable in pockets, especially most parts of western Maharashtra. 

						</p>

						<p>
							We had an excellent opportunity to meet and interact with our leaders in the last 'Communiqu&eacute;' on July 9. Hope you have understood their message and will follow the same. At each level, each one of you can contribute. If anyone of you feel like asking a few questions and get yourselves some clarity, please do so without fail. We earnestly need people to talk to us and interact with us. Remember, each one of you can contribute no matter what work you do.
						</p>

						<p>For all these years of my working career, I have learnt the most about business by interacting with leaders. They have vision, knowledge and experience and they know how to make a best mix  of all of that for growth and improvement.</p>

						<p>On the subject of TOC, I feel sometimes, that may be, we are not reading TOC enough. We need to do that more often, learn and read more and more about TOC. It isn't just about business but is a way of life and it balances work - life.  If you need to know more about it, please get in touch with Poonam Choudhari or Radhika Kulkarni for accessing the library that we have at our headquarters in Pune.</p>

						<p>Our "CSR" activity is taking a nice shape and we are glad to know that the participation from many of you is making it meaningful and noble. If anyone wants to give any suggestion or wants to participate, please contact our CSR leader, Shraddha Kapade. Her presentation on CSR in our last Board Meeting was much appreciated. </p>

					<div class="para">
						<p>
							I am sure, you all are aware of the "Code of Conduct" and its importance at work place and also of the consequences of not complying with it. We would like to avoid untoward incidences and wish to have a safe and ethical business environment in Fleetguard Filters.  We will conduct workshops for awareness about these documents through formal and informal platforms across all our business places PAN India. 
						</p>

						<p>
							I am the official contact for <span class="maroonText">"Whistle Blower"</span> of Fleetguard Filters and expect to know of anything untoward and improper happening around anyone of you. The key is it should be made known to me our your HOD, INSTANEOUSLY. I want to assure you that we have a mechanism to take care of  issues around this and a few such cases have been dealt with successfully in the past. You can write to <a href="mailto:whistleblower@fleetguard-filtrum.com"> whistleblower@fleetguard-filtrum.com</a> for reporting any untoward or improper incidence.
						</p>

						<p>
							Our fellow women associates add lot of value, colour and acumen to our business environment and I hope this grows over a period of time.  We cherish their fellowship and wish to utilize these traits more often in future. 
						</p>
						<p>
							We all at HR, would be eager to have your suggestions and feedbacks as to how we can make our working environment happier and enjoyable.  We are taking a few baby steps and your contribution will make a lot of difference to take this forward to the next level. 
						</p>
						<p>
							If you ask me, I am eager to go to my work place every day, so that I can meet many of my close friends there. Hope this happens to you too.
						</p>
						<p>
							All the best....
						</p>

						<p>
							With Regards,<br/>Sanjay Kulkarni
						</p>
