							Let me start with an everyday experience that all of us have faced at some point in life. We often attend seminars, lectures and conferences but more often than not we are the last ones to ask any questions. Not because we don't have any but because we feel shy, we feel that our questions may be stupid and that people may laugh at us. It is said that a lot of ideas are killed in their very first stages because people are too scared to even voice them because they always worry about what will people say! In all of this we miss the biggest joy in our lives - the joy of learning!

						</p>

						<p>
							Let's read this story - the story of our own HoD of Engineering, R&amp;D and ALD - Dr. A K Vaikuntam and his experience with the 'Missile Man' of India himself, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalaam.
						</p>

						<p>
							In the year 1996, after finishing his PhD at IIT, Kharagpur AKV received a very prestigious German scholarship - the DAAD. He was selected for doing a research for a span of 2.5 years at Germany. While studying there, AKV met Mr. Suresh Deshpande - his professor for Mathematics. Mr. Suresh Deshpande was a brilliant person and had closely worked with APJ. AKV was working there as research associate and his work was primarily in the area of computational fluid dynamics and it involved developing a code using Object Oriented Programming.
						</p>

						<p>
							Once while APJ was in Germany, his professor - Mr. Deshpande introduced AKV to APJ Abdul Kalaam. They got in to a conversation about AKV's area of work and then AKV was asked to make a presentation about his work. When he started presenting, APJ was quiet the whole time. Never in his life had he used the technology of coding as AKV was using it. After an interval of about 45 minutes, he absorbed everything in the presentation and then he asked questions - a lot of questions. In AKV's own words 'He kept asking me questions with a lot of patience and inquisitiveness. While he understood the nitty gritties of what I do and how I do it, APJ was already dreaming about how a generic algorithm can solve certain problems. That man, he had big dreams and the desire to follow them'.
						</p>

						<p>
							I'm sure we all have read a lot of APJ's quotes and read a lot of his stories. One thing - one important thing that always reflects in his work and in his life is that he was always eager to learn. His ego never came in the way of learning. He was a live example for the entire world who showed us the importance of being open to new ideas - importance of learning new things! In APJ's own words - 'All of us do not have equal talent but all of us have equal opportunity to develop our talents'.
						</p>

						<p>
							Let us resolve to never miss an opportunity. Let's be open minded and let our ego never come in the way of learning. This alone can change our lives.
						</p>
