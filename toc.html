						<!-- <h3>The<br/>Selfish<br/>Altruist</h3> -->
						<p>
							Dear Friends...
						</p>

						<p>
							As you are aware, we are following TOC DNA programme in our organisation. In this month we will discuss important topic of TOC Finance measurements and Cash flow.
						</p>

						<p>
							An old adage says: <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">"Revenue is vanity, Cash flow is sanity, but Cash is king"</span> In other words, just because a <span style="font-weight: bold;">business appears profitable</span> on paper doesn't mean it isn't <span style="font-weight: bold;">on the verge of bankruptcy as well.</span>
						</p>

						<p>
							To understand TOC and to apply it effectively to an organization, one must completely understand the goal of the organization (for this essay, it is assumed that organization refers to a profit-seeking entity, as opposed to a nonprofit one). Dr. Goldratt, in <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">"The Goal"</span>, emphasized that the goal of any organization is to make money. It is important therefore to create a set of measurements that honestly and accurately allow an organization to monitor its performance as it relates to its goal.  In the TOC we are measuring the performance on following parameters.
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Throughput:</span> The rate at which the system generates new money through sales.</li>
							<li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Inventory:</span> Money the system has invested in things it intends to sell, which would include plant, property, and equipment.</li>
							<li><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Operating expense:</span> The money spent to convert inventory into throughout.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							In TOC implemented Organizations performance is measured on following parameters-
							<br>T/ OE = No. time Throughput generated by spending on Operating Expenses 
							<br>T/ I = % of Throughput generate by Inventory in Hand.
						</p>

						<p>
							If we closely observed these principle measurements are related to generation of Cash, Investing Cash which will result in generation of cash and spending of Cash to generate the more Cash. Normally in finance performance of an Organization measured on its Profit generated during the prescribed period. In TOC we have not only work for generating the profits at a decent rate, but also to look for convert it in cash.
						</p>

						<p>
							Cash flow is often referred to as the <span style="color: red; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">lifeblood</span> of a business. But many of business Executives know too little about this crucial measure of a business's vitality. -
						</p>

						<p>
							What problems can arise if you don't stay on top of your cash flow?
						</p>

						<p>
							First, you'll find yourself unable to pay creditors or employees on time. You might need to borrow money, which is costly and difficult. And if you are making payments late, your business credit rating will suffer, making it even harder to find financing and sending your business into a downward spiral. Poor cash flow management can [ultimately] drive a profitable business into bankruptcy.
						</p>

						<p>
							Following are the illustrative examples of actions to be taken which will help to improve the Cash flow-
						</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Formalize and implement a proper credit policy</li>
							<li>Invoice customer promptly</li>
							<li>Keep close eye on customer payment</li>
							<li>Offer small discount for early payment</li>
							<li>Should have good Collection policy</li>
							<li>Buffer Management system for Inventory</li>
							<li>Use of Replenishment Model for Inventory</li>
							<li>Management of Slow Moving Inventory</li>
							<li>Use of Exploitation before making Capital Investment</li>
							<li>Optimum Capital investment by way of Negotiation with Vendor</li>
							<li>Credit Term Negotiations with Vendors</li>
						</ol>

						<p>
							As you aware mere Operational profit will not sufficient for organization to grow and prosper along with that the Cash should be in hand as ultimately "<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: green">CASH IS THE KING</span>".......
