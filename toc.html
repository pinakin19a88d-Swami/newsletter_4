						<!-- <h3>The<br/>Selfish<br/>Altruist</h3> -->
						<p>
							Back in year 2007 and before we used to place order with our suppliers based purely on forecast. The forecast would start broadly at monthly level and then move eventually to daily through weekly forecasting. This system of order management was broadly based on forecast and hence was unstable which created a lot of strain on the plant as well as the suppliers Most of the time there was a mismatch in what was ordered and what was required to be produced by the plant and vice versa. This resulted in inventory pile up at our as well as the suppliers end. Forecast inherently has buffers built in to it, with every level in the supply chain these buffers go on increasing. This process creates wastages. The processesâ€™ end result was a complete CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION as we were not able to do on time delivery and also were unable to deliver what was required.
						</p>

						<p>
							Sooner we realized that there is a big gap in the processes of order management and it needs to be addressed urgently. In the year 2008-09 we implemented UNNATI, a model which was based only on actual consumption with priority as indicated by the buffer penetration percentage. UNNATI thus showed us the way to eliminate the forecasting system involved in Order Management. UNNATI has essentially taken away all the wastages and works only on the principle of replenishment against actual consumption.
						</p>

						<p>
							The need to manually place the order does not exist anymore. The systemization has happened in such a way that there goes a digital communication about exact demand available to all across all our vendors on daily basis at 0830 am on the WEB portal, popularly known as the daily trigger.
						</p>

						<p>
							Since the time UNNATI is implemented, the suppliers as well as we are freed of the inventory pile ups and stock outs and the plant is able to do an on time delivery of whatever is required.
						</p>

						<p>
							Which principle of TOC can you identify from the above write up? TOC as we say is the DNA of our organization, we would welcome you all to share the way you implement TOC in your daily routine.
